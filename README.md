# BG3-Custom-Tiefling-Horns-Code-Generator
 Tool that creates the code blocks necessary for creating Baldur's Gate 3 mods that add new horns for Tiefling characters. Have created a new one for all races so this is defunct and slightly incomplete.

Proper README with usage instructions is in the works. This was originally made for personal use at my partner's request, and not intended for public release, so it's more esoteric than I would have liked. It's public anyhow because this version has a few features I haven't implemented in the all-races version yet, as well as being able to generate only Tiefling horn code if a modder/artist isn't interested in modifying the meshes/anchors/etc for other races.
